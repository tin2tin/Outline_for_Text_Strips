# Outline for text strips in the Blender video Sequence Editor (VSE)
Add outlines to selected text strips by using a black background text with glow and a white text on top.

## FYI
A font size driver is set up for the lower text strip, so change this value to get outline and text to scale in sync.

The glow effect isn't optimized internally to run multi threaded, so the fps will suffer.
